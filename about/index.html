     <font face=arial color=red size=+2>I</font> am 19 years old and I am currently pursuing my higher education in computer science at heriot watt university.
     Honestly I never thought that I would make it this far, since childhood everyone told me that I was different and that I don't fit in with the crowd, the reason why 
     they thought that I was different was because I was quiet most of the time, didn't understand social norms and was always distracted and at times very straightforward
     which made people think that I was rude. I was sensitive to bright lights and loud sounds and still am to this day but now I do know how to manage it. My Teachers thought
     that I was a lost cause, they told that I was lazy, never focused or even tried to be mentally present in the class, I spent many periods standing outside of the classroom during my
     middle school days. But the truth is that I did try but always failed. By the start of high school I had almost given up.

    I enjoy almost everything about science and also like reading history, philosophy, criminal psychology books. I have always dreamed of being an astronaut.
