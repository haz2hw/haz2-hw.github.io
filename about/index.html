 I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to make their lives better and help them have an uplifting experience.I enjoy reading,
 and the knowledge and perspective that my reading gives me has strengthened my knowledge and also my speaking skills which I used to struggle with.
 I love to share the knowledge I have with the people I meet. I am a very curious, I love experimenting, whether it be with art, music, or technology.
 I always have a fresh perspective to offer and love flipping ideas upside down. I am someone with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
 Sometimes that means staying up reading until 2 in the morning because I simply must know what happens or how it works.
 I enjoy almost everything about science and also like reading history, philosophy, criminal psychology books. I have always dreamed of being an astronaut.
